/**
 * Builders that produce the InverseRecord (reverse tool call + optional state
 * snapshot) stored with every executed tool so the action can be undone.
 * CRITICAL INVARIANT: every executor in ./tools.ts must call a matching builder
 * here, in lockstep — a missing/incorrect inverse breaks undo silently.
 * Some inverse `tool` names (restoreCountdown, noop) are SERVER-ONLY undo
 * operations resolved by applyInverse — they are NOT in the model-facing catalog
 * or client executors.
 * @see $lib/server/ai-undo.ts (applies these), ./executor.ts (records them).
